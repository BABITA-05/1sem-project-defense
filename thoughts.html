                 Listening to the music, walking on the paths, realising and filtering all those untimely thoughts of mine. Yes, this is me coming back from college.
                 <br><br>
                When life becomes harsh on me, I start asking myself should I have to live it or just existing is enough?
                <br><br>
                Sometimes, I feel like I've no purpose of living, I don't know what is going on around me, I just gaze into my thoughts so deeply that I don't see anyone, hear anyone, can't feel the presence of anyone.
                <br><br>
                It becomes even harder  when you realise all those nights with a heavy heart, those days with tired eyes, a restless body. All those silences, those tears, those heartaches came from a reason that can't be explained, can't be determined and can't be consoled. 
                <br><br>
                Life is hard to live with those unsaid thoughts, suppressed feelings and the burden of those emotions which can't be shared or talked to anyone.

              Why does the 'Love' always compared with the roses, sunshine, the stars, the moon and the colour red?
               <br> <br>
              BUT WHY IT DOESN'T? <br> <br>
             Why doesn't it compare with the leaf of a tree that falls every time when the wind blows a lil harder?
             <br> <br>
              Why doesn't it compare with thorns that pierce every time when someone tries to pick up the rose?<br>
               Why doesn't it compare with the rain that falls every time when the sky can't hold the burden of it?
               <br> <br>
             Why doesn't it compare with the dark that comes when you lose all of your colours of life?
             <br> <br>
              Why doesn't it compare with those tears that come every time when you feel something truly?
              <br> <br>
             See the things with every edges of it.<br> 
             Every edge gives you different sights to have different perspectives.<br>
