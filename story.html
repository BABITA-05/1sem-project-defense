                 Arish and Anya were once deeply in love. Their days were filled with laughter, warmth, and endless conversations. They understood each other without words, their bond pure and unbreakable—or so they believed. 
                 <br><br>
                 But sometimes, love isn't enough when misunderstandings creep in. Their relationship wasn't destroyed by betrayal or lies. It was the small moments of miscommunication, the unsaid words, and the stubborn silence that built walls between them. Neither of them wanted to hurt the other, yet both felt unheard. One argument turned into another, and before they realized it, their love story ended—not because they stopped loving each other, but because they couldn't find a way to make it work.
                 <br><br>

                 Now, they walk separate paths, pretending to be fine. When they cross paths, they exchange polite smiles, carefully hiding the pain in their eyes. Their hearts still ache for each other, but pride keeps them apart. They miss the comfort of each other's presence, the way they once found home in each other's arms. 
                 <br><br>

                 Even in their solitude, they still love. Even in their silence, they still long. But they choose to suffer behind fake smiles, convincing the world—and maybe even themselves—that they are happy. But deep inside, they know the truth: they are not.

                 <b><i>Moral:</i></b><br>
                 Love is not just about feelings; it requires understanding, patience, and communication. Sometimes, pride and misunderstandings can separate even the purest of hearts. True happiness comes not from pretending to be okay but from embracing vulnerability and expressing emotions before it's too late.
