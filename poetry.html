            Last winter <br>
            we were together <br>
            Holding hands of each other
            <br><br>
            Last winter <br>
            Felt warm in December <br>
            Didn't feel like ever 
            <br><br>
            Last winter <br>
            We were a dreamer <br>
            Dreaming of living together 
            <br><br>
            Last winter<br> 
            You smelled like a flower<br> 
            And I loved you like a lover
            <br><br>
            Last winter <br>
            You were like a letter<br> 
            And I was a reader 
            <br><br>
            Last winter<br>
            You were my healer <br>
            Who healed my pain, and I wonder 
            <br><br>
            Last winter<br> 
            You were a lover<br>
            I was a lover <br>
            But, now we are not together

            Oh, it's march again,<br>
          Same light, same sky<br>
          But the air weighs a bit heavier,<br>
          Carrying the love of yours.
          <br><br>

          Oh, it's my heart again,<br>
          Does it bloom this time or <br>
          fade away it's colour again?<br>
          Like the last time
          <br><br>

          Those burden of my life<br>
          Felt a lil bit light,<br>
          With those smiling eyes and <br>
          Soulful heart of yours.
          <br><br>

          Oh, it's his grace this time,<br>
          Same sight, same vibe,<br>
          But different feeling of love<br> 
          That knocks the door of my heart.
          <br><br>

          Oh, it's you, my love<br> 
          Trying to aid my aches of heart,<br>
          Healing those scars with your love,<br>
          Brightning my soul with a luminous grin.
          <br><br>

          Feels so deep like the ocean,<br>
          Peaceful like staring the skies at night,<br>
          Yes, it's your love that carries my heart with a grace.<br>
